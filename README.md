# Exchange-NewMailbox
I created this short Powershell script to automate mailbox creation, as anybody knows, it gets tedious to remember to add every single parameter for new users.

This script is meant to demonstrate how to automate the creation of a new user and associated mailbox, as well as setting all parameters for the mailbox and user based on as little input as possible.
